Bower

Bower is a front-end dependency manager for your project. In laymans terms, it is a command-line program which you can utilize to download libraries such as Twitter Bootstrap. The beauty of this approach is that we can generate a bower.json file, which any user can copy and use to download a bunch of packages easily - as opposed to going to each site, and manually copy/pasting/saving out files.

In this step, I’ll walk you through downloading Twitter bootstrap as well as generating your own bower.json. Before we do this, we’ll create a .bowerrc file.

In the same directory as manage.py, create a .bowerrc file with the following content:

{
    "directory": "app/static/"
}

Anytime we run bower, it will output the downloaded files within the directory listed here.

    Tip: There is a huge array of configuration options which can be used, for those curious.

And now in our command line, we can simply run:

$ bower install bootstrap

This will download Twitter Bootstrap into our project directory, as specified within our .bowerrc file.
